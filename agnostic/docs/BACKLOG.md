# SecureVibe Agnostic — what is still to do

Same rules as the v1 backlog: claim an item here, in a commit of its own, before starting it. A message to
another session is not a claim.

## Next

- **Corroborators for the remaining claims.** Eleven of the twelve were written on 24 September 2026;
  `shared-hostname` is recorded as uncheckable instead (`noCorroborator`), because it is a fact about
  deployment that the repository does not hold. What is left is the weaker half of what was written:
  `ai-history` and `multimodal-ai` lean almost entirely on source patterns, and `public-api` cannot see
  a key checked by hand against a query parameter. Each is a data entry, not machinery.

- **Script in a page written the way a browser reads it and a parser does not.** An unquoted
  attribute value, and a scheme written around a control character, are both named as left behind —
  correct, and each keeps a page unread. Reading them means deciding where an unquoted value ends,
  which is a question with two defensible answers.

- **Grammars for C++, and for HTML's embedded scripts.** C++ is the last language the scanner counts and
  cannot parse. It is also what the two "no grammar" tests now stand on, so whoever adds it will find
  those two failing, which is the right way round.

- **More AST rules.** Five cover code execution, shell, backticks, SQL and deserialization, across seven
  languages. Path traversal, weak cryptography and unvalidated redirects are the obvious next ones, and
  each is a data entry per language.

- **Read Maven and Gradle version ranges.** The lockfile check reports them as not assessed, because
  pinning lives in `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` rather than a lockfile. Reading a range out of either
  would turn an open question into an answer.

- **More adapters, and more of their rules mapped.** Four are listed; semgrep's rule ids are not mapped
  to requirements at all, so its findings carry none. `eslint-plugin-security`, `staticcheck` and
  `phpcs-security-audit` are each a data entry. The shape to keep: SARIF only, not installed means not
  run, and rule ids mapped one at a time.

- **More probes.** The first four questions are asked (`sv-check/src/probes.rs`); they are the ones that
  can be asked of any app by somebody who has not signed in. Redirects, HSTS on an HTTPS app, method
  handling per route and anything that sends data need either a manifest describing the app's routes or a
  session — both of which are their own items below.

- **Seeded users.** The probes sign in as nobody, so authorisation, session handling and CSRF are reported
  as *not assessed* and named as such. v1's probes sign in as users it created. Doing that for an arbitrary app means the manifest
  declaring how, or the probes running unauthenticated and saying which requirements that leaves unassessed.

- ~~**Load the Secure by Design checklist.**~~ Done on 24 September 2026. Left over: `multiple-services`
  is a claim with no corroborator, so nothing looks for a compose file or a set of deployment manifests
  to check it against — the one question gating fifteen controls rests entirely on somebody's word. The
  checklist's `scoring`, `processSteps`, `principles` and `escalationTriggers` are read past, not used.
  It was found on 24 September 2026 while chasing bad citations: `sv --help` had named the checklist
  since the first commit while `Frameworks::load` read ASVS, AISVS and Appendix C only.

- **Clean coverage from the remaining checks.** The credential scan, the rules that read code and the
  probes now report what they examined and found nothing wrong; the SBOM and advisory checks do not, and
  neither does the app's own test suite when `sv run` runs it. Each fails closed on its own coverage,
  which is the pattern to follow.

- ~~**Credit the app's own test suite.**~~ Done on 24 September 2026 — `crates/sv-check/src/suite.rs`.
  A test counts only for a requirement it names, and only when the suite it belongs to passed. Matching
  tests to requirements by their words was considered and refused: it would credit a requirement on the
  strength of a name somebody chose for other reasons. v1's mismatch check is ported as it was —
  reporting, never withholding credit, because about a third of its flags are honest tests phrased
  differently. What is left over from this item: the suite's coverage is still all-or-nothing on one
  exit code, so a suite with one failing test credits nothing. Reading a test runner's own report
  (JUnit XML, `pytest --junitxml`) would fix that and is its own item.

- ~~**Almost every rule-to-requirement citation is semantically wrong.**~~ Done on 24 September 2026 —
  remapped, and guarded by `crates/sv-check/tests/citations.rs`. Left over: Brakeman's rule ids have
  never been seen in a real SARIF run, and the guard cannot catch a swap between requirements that
  share vocabulary. Found on 24 September 2026 by the
  test-crediting mismatch check, firing on the example app written to demonstrate it. ASVS 5.0 `V1.2.1`
  is *output encoding for an HTTP response, HTML or XML document*. It is cited by `ast.sql-built-by-hand`,
  `ast.dynamic-code-execution`, bandit's `B608` and `B307`, gosec's `G201`/`G202`, and three Brakeman
  rules — none of which have anything to do with output encoding. Parameterised queries are **V1.2.4**;
  OS command injection is **V1.2.5**, not the `V1.2.2` that nine adapter rules cite (`V1.2.2` is URL
  encoding). The pattern repeats across the file: eight rules cite `V11.3.1` (block modes and padding)
  for weak hashes, which are `V11.4.1`; `G404` (`math/rand`) cites `V11.4.1` (hash functions) when
  unpredictable randomness is `V11.5.1`; `G304` (file paths) cites `V1.2.3` (JavaScript encoding) when
  it is `V5.3.2`; `G107` (SSRF) cites `V1.2.4` (database queries) when it is `V1.3.6`; `G402`/`B501`
  (TLS verification off) cite `V13.1.1`, which asks that communication needs be *documented*.

  This is the third time this class has been found here — five checkers citing `AC-NN` ids that did not
  exist, then every probe citation being semantically wrong — and it is the failure the whole product is
  most exposed to, because a wrong citation is not visibly wrong. It puts a finding, or a green line,
  against a requirement nobody examined, and the reader has no way to tell.

  Two things are needed, and the second matters more. Remap `data/adapters.json` and `data/ast-rules.json`
  by reading each requirement's text. Then write the guard that would have caught it without an example
  app happening to exist: every citation in the data files compared against the requirement it names, by
  shared vocabulary, the same comparison `suite.rs` already makes for tests. A citation nothing checks is
  a citation that drifts.

- **Read the test runner's own report.** *Claimed 24 September 2026, session keen-meninsky-691a27.*
  `suite.rs` credits a requirement only when the whole suite passed, because `sv run` sees one exit
  code and cannot say which tests it came from. So one failing test anywhere credits nothing at all,
  however many of the other forty name a requirement and passed. Every runner in the manifest's
  languages can write JUnit XML (`pytest --junitxml`, `go test` through gotestsum, `jest
  --reporters=jest-junit`, surefire, rspec's formatter), and that names each test case and says
  whether it passed. Reading it turns the all-or-nothing into per-test credit. The trap is that a
  report which is absent, truncated or from a previous run must never read as "everything passed" —
  a stale file is the failure mode here, exactly as a missing tool was for the adapters.

- **The MCP server.** Wraps the same core so an AI coding tool can run the checks mid-conversation. Wants
  `sv check` finished first.

## Decided, not yet written down as ADRs

- Corroboration only ever moves toward more requirements applying, never fewer (`sv-manifest::resolve`).
- The OWASP data files are shared with v1, not copied.
- `sv` never writes application code, so v1's generation agent and its fence have no successor here.
